                          volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                          core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                          When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                          the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                          provisioner.
                          This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                          if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                          compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                          both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                          value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                          When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                          dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                          There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                          * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                            allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                          * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                            preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                            specified.
                          * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                            in any namespaces.
                          (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                          (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                          it can be changed after the claim is created. An empty string value means that no VolumeAttributesClass
                          will be applied to the claim but it's not allowed to reset this field to empty string once it is set.
                          If unspecified and the PersistentVolumeClaim is unbound, the default VolumeAttributesClass
                          will be set by the persistentvolume controller if it exists.
                          If the resource referred to by volumeAttributesClass does not exist, this PersistentVolumeClaim will be
                          set to a Pending state, as reflected by the modifyVolumeStatus field, until such as a resource
                          exists.

                          There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                          * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                            allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                          * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                            preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                            specified.
                          * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                            in any namespaces.

                            preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                            specified.
                          * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                            in any namespaces.

                      volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                      core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                      When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                      the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                      provisioner.
                      This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                      if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                      compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                      both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                      value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                      When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                      dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                      There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                      * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                        allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                      * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                        preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                        specified.
                      * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                        in any namespaces.
                      (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                      (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                      volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                      core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                      When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                      the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                      provisioner.
                      This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                      if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                      compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                      both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                      value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                      When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                      dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                      There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                      * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                        allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                      * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                        preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                        specified.
                      * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                        in any namespaces.
                      (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                      (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                      * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                        allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                      * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                        preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                        specified.
                      * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                        in any namespaces.
                      (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                      (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
